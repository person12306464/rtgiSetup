# rtgiSetup
**Sets up rtgi for you.**

**Put your rtgi in the same folder as the executable.**

*Made for version 0.36.1*

## Just open cmd as admin and run main2.py to install it without making it an exe.

**Though if you would like to make your own exe then follow this:**

First do `pip install pyinstaller`

Then `pyinstaller main.py`

Then to make the actual exe do `pyinstaller --name rtgiSetup --onefile --icon=icon.ico --uac-admin main.py`
